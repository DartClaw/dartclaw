# Architecture Decision Records

Public-canonical decision records for DartClaw. ADRs are standalone development documents; private PRDs, FIS files, and raw research are not required to read them.

| # | Title | Status | Date | Research |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | [SDK Integration Strategy and Security Architecture](001-sdk-integration-and-security-architecture.md) | Superseded — Phase 0 Direct Bridge Migration (2026-02-25). Option C (Hybrid: Dart→Deno→claude) replaced by Option D+ (Dart→claude directly via JSONL control protocol). The Deno worker layer was eliminated; Dart now spawns the native `claude` binary as a direct subprocess. See Addendum and Recommendation sections below for the analysis that drove this decision. | 2026-02-17 (revised; original: 2026-02-16; addendum: 2026-02-25; superseded: 2026-02-25) | — |
| 002 | [File-Based Storage with Lightweight Search Index](002-file-based-storage.md) | Accepted — fully implemented. File-based storage (NDJSON + JSON) is the production storage layer. Drift ORM fully removed. | 2026-02-23 (accepted: 2026-02-27) | — |
| 003 | [Coding Task Support and Agent Extensibility](003-coding-task-support-and-agent-extensibility.md) | Accepted — partially superseded by Phase 0 Direct Bridge Migration (2026-02-25). Mechanism changed from SDK JS options to JSONL control protocol. Core decisions (layered extensibility, `.claude/` ecosystem, security options via bridge) remain valid. | 2026-02-23 (addendum: 2026-02-27) | — |
| 004 | [Vector Search Approach for Hybrid Memory](004-vector-search-approach.md) | Accepted — fully implemented. Two-tier search: FTS5 built-in (default) + QMD outpost (opt-in via `search.backend: qmd`). `QmdManager`, `QmdSearchBackend`, and `SearchBackendFactory` in `dartclaw_core`. | 2026-02-25 (accepted: 2026-02-27) | [Appendix](research/004-vector-search-approach.md) |
| 005 | [WhatsApp Integration Approach](005-whatsapp-integration.md) | Accepted — fully implemented. GOWA sidecar (whatsmeow/Go) with REST API + webhooks. `GowaManager`, `WhatsAppChannel`, DM access control, mention gating, QR pairing UI all in `dartclaw_core`/`dartclaw_server`. | 2026-02-25 (accepted: 2026-02-27) | [Appendix](research/005-whatsapp-integration.md) |
| 006 | [HTTP Auth Scope and Mechanism](006-http-auth-scope.md) | Accepted — fully implemented. Token bootstrap + session cookie (Option C). `AuthMiddleware`, `TokenService`, `SessionStore`, login page, security headers all in `dartclaw_server`. | 2026-02-25 (accepted: 2026-02-27) | — |

The canonical tool taxonomy, `HarnessFactory`, and heterogeneous-pool model below remain in force. | 2026-03-22 (validated 2026-03-24) | [Appendix](research/016-multi-provider-harness-architecture.md) |
